## Flask password protection

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework.

An instance of the Flask application is created with app = Flask(__name__). This instance represents the web application and all its functionalities.

A route for login is then defined using @app.route('/submit-login', methods=['POST']). This tells Flask which function should run when a user navigates to a specific URL. In this case the login page.

When a user submits the login form, Flaskâ€™s request.form is used to retrieve the username and password from the form data.

Before storing the password in a database, the password is hashed using a library like hashlib. This transforms the password into a fixed-length sequence of bytes adding a layer of security.

When a user logs in the entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash. If the hashes match, the password is verified
